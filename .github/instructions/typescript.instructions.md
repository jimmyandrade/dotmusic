# Instructions for TypeScript and TypeScript React files

## Single Responsibility

Always consider extracting logic into functions with a single responsibility. This improves code cohesion and reusability.

## Unused Variables

Avoid declaring variables or constants that are not used in the code. Always remove unused declarations to keep the code clean.

## Comments

Do not include comments explaining what the code is doing. Prefer clear and descriptive function, variable, and component names instead of explanatory comments.
