# Front Matter

Always respect the front matter block at the top of .md and .mdx files. Do not add any content or instructions above it.

# Markdown Instructions

All `.md` and `.mdx` files must include a front matter block at the top of the file with a `title:` property specifying the document title.

Example:

```
---
title: My Document Title
---

Content goes here...
```
