## Scripts

When adding a new script to the `scripts` section in `package.json`, always ensure that all scripts are organized in strict alphabetical order by their key.

## Dependencies

All dependencies and devDependencies in `package.json` must have their versions pinned (no version ranges, wildcards, or caret/tilde symbols). Use exact version numbers only.
