✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

Happy coding!

## Run tasks

To start the development server run.

```sh
npx nx dev app-name
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build app-name
```

To build a specific library use:

```sh
npx nx build library-name
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project app-name
```

To execute any tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name> <...options>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or can be defined in the `package.json` or `project.json` files.

You can also run multiple targets:

```sh
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```sh
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects).

## Generate new projects

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/next:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

To generate a library that is publishable:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>`.

Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use:

```sh
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Want better Editor Integration? Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

Have a look at the [Install Nx Console &raquo;](https://nx.dev/nx-console) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE. It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
